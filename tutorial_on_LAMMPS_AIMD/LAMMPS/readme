# Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulation of Melting Using LAMMPS

Welcome to this tutorial! In this guide, I will demonstrate how to simulate the **melting process** of materials using **Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations** with **LAMMPS** (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator), an open-source package for simulating atomic interactions.

## Installation of LAMMPS

Before running MD simulations, you need to install LAMMPS. Below are the installation steps for different operating systems.

(A) Installing LAMMPS on Windows
1. Visit the official LAMMPS download page:  
   ðŸ‘‰ [LAMMPS Downloads](https://lammps.org/download.html)  
2. Download the latest Stable Release (LAMMPS Stable Release - 29 Aug 2024).
3. Follow the installation instructions provided on the website.

(B) Installing LAMMPS on macOS
1. Ensure that **Homebrew** is pre-installed on your Mac. If not, install it using: /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
2. Visit the official macOS installation guide:  
   ðŸ‘‰ [LAMMPS macOS Installation](https://docs.lammps.org/Install_mac.html)
3. Install LAMMPS using Homebrew: brew install lammps
   
Files Required for MD Simulations in LAMMPS

To run any MD simulation, you need three essential files:

1. Input File (`.in` file)
- Defines the simulation parameters, including temperature, pressure, time steps, and thermodynamic output settings.
- Example:
   units metal
   atom_style atomic
   boundary p p p
   read_data structure.lmp

2. Structure File (`.lmp` or `.data` file)
- Contains structural information such as lattice parameters, atomic coordinates, and box dimensions.
- Example snippet:
   5000 atoms
   1 atom types
   0.0 50.0 xlo xhi
   0.0 50.0 ylo yhi
   0.0 50.0 zlo zhi

3. Force Field File (`.eam`, `.eam.alloy`, or `.potentials` file)
- Defines the **interatomic interactions** using **empirical potentials** such as **EAM, MEAM, or LJ potentials**.
- Example usage:
   pair_style eam/alloy
   pair_coeff * * Mishin-Ni-Al-2009.eam.alloy Al

Running an MD Simulation in LAMMPS
Once you have prepared the input, structure, and force field files, you can run the simulation using:


lmp_serial -in simulation.in

Visualizing the Results
To analyze and visualize the simulation results, you can use OVITO (Open Visualization Tool):
1. Download OVITO from [ovito.org](https://www.ovito.org/).
2. Open the `.dump` file generated by LAMMPS.
3. Apply color coding** to visualize atomic temperatures, phase changes, and melting processes.
