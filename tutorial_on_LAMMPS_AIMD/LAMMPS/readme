Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulation of Melting Using LAMMPS
Welcome to this tutorial! In this guide, I will demonstrate how to simulate the melting process of materials using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations with LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator), an open-source package for simulating atomic interactions.
